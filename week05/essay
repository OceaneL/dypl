Describe what you would need to add
support for considering the types of the argument values when binding an invocation
to a certain method;

In the method invoke that I have created, I need to take on argument the name of the type of the argument. I also need to add the name of the type of the argument in the structure Method. So in the function findMethod I can add the criterium of the type.
